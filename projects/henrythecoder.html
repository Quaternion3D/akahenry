        <h3>HenryTheCoder</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">In 2011 I started a YouTube channel called HenryTheCoder, where I taught people how to program modifications (mods) into the game Minecraft. Minecraft is written in Java, and a large aspect of the game is its modding community. When I was first teaching myself how to make mods, I was dissatisfied at the quality of tutorials available online, so I decided to make my own tutorials. My goal was to create tutorials that were as clear and easy to follow as possible, so that even people who had never programmed before could try them. I taught people how to "deobfuscate" the game's code so that it could be edited, modify it to add custom blocks, items, or abilities, and then repackage the modified code so that other players could install their newly created mod. To date, the channel has accumulated over 400,000 views and had over 4,300 subscribers at its peak. The difficulty with this project was that Minecraft is still in development, thus it is constantly updating. Each update would often require my tutorials to be adjusted, which was very time consuming. I stopped updating the channel in 2013 in order to pursue other projects.</p>
